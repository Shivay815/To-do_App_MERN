# MERN Stack To-Do App

We aim to build a full-stack MERN To-Do application. It covers setting up the environment, writing code to demonstrate core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and connecting the application to MongoDB Atlas, a free cloud database.

## Introduction to the MERN Stack

The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript stack for building modern web applications. It consists of:

1. MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing data.

2. Express.js: A backend framework for building APIs.

3. React (UI library) + Vite (build tool) + TypeScript (typed JavaScript): A modern frontend stack for building scalable and maintainable user interfaces.

4. Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
